#### Data Analysis Steps

Data for this project can be found in the data/ folder. It was gathered from Cot's Baseball Contracts (https://legacy.baseballprospectus.com/compensation/cots/) and FanGraphs (https://www.fangraphs.com/). 

Data wrangling and cleaning is done in the scripts 00_batter_data_clean and 00_pitcher_data_clean. Outputs from this are saved in the data/ folder and used in the analysis scripts 01_batter_analysis and 01_pitcher_analysis. Might not be the prettiest analysis but models and predictions are saved in data/ folder to import into Project-Report R Markdown file.
